**Relational databases** adhere to particular schemas before storing the data. The data stored in relational databases has prior structure.

### NoSQL - Not Only SQL

A NoSQL database is designed for a variety of data models to access and manage data.

These databases are used in applications that require a large volume of semi-structured and unstructured data, low latency, and flexible data models.

**Note**: When NoSQL databases first came into being, they were drastically different to program and use as compared to traditional databases. Though, due to extensive research in academia and industry over the last many years, the programmer-facing differences between NoSQL and traditional stores are blurring. We might be using the same SQL constructs to talk to a NoSQL store and get a similar level of performance and consistency as a traditional store. Google’s Cloud Spanner is one such database that’s geo-replicated with automatic horizontal sharding ability and high-speed global snapshots of data.
