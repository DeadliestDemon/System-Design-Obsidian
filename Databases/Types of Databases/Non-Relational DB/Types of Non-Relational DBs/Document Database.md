A **document database** is designed to store and retrieve documents in formats like XML, JSON, BSON, and so on.

These documents are composed of a hierarchical tree data structure that can include maps, collections, and scalar values. Documents in this type of database may have varying structures and data

### Examples:
MongoDB and Google Cloud Firestore 

### Use-Case:

Document databases are suitable for unstructured catalog data, like JSON files or other complex structured hierarchical data. For example, in e-commerce applications, a product has thousands of attributes, which is unfeasible to store in a relational database due to its impact on the reading performance.

Moreover, it’s also a good option for content management applications, such as blogs and video platforms.
