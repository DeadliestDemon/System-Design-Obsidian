## What is Maintainability
Keeping the system up and running by finding and fixing bugs, adding new functionalities, keeping the system’s platform updated, and ensuring smooth system operations. One of the salient features to define such requirements of an exemplary system design is maintainability. We can further divide the concept of maintainability into three underlying aspects:

- **Operability:** Ease with which we can ensure the system’s smooth operational running under normal circumstances and achieve normal conditions under a fault.
- **Lucidity:** The simplicity of the code. The simpler the code base, the easier it is to understand and maintain it, and vice versa.
- **Modifiability:** The capability of the system to integrate modified, new, and unforeseen features without any hassle.
## Measuring Maintainability
**Maintainability**, M, is the probability that the service will restore its functions within a specified time of fault occurrence. M measures how conveniently and swiftly the service regains its normal operating conditions.

We use (mean time to repair) MTTR as the metric to measure `M`
