## What is Reliability
**Reliability**, `R`, is the probability that the service will perform its functions for a specified time. `R` measures how the service performs under varying operating conditions.

**MTBF ( Mean Time Between Failures ) -**

**MTTR ( Mean Time to Repair )**

***Preferred - High MTBF, low MTTR***

### Comparison with Availability
The measurement of availability is driven by time loss, whereas the frequency and impact of failures drive the measure of reliability. Availability and reliability are essential because they enable the stakeholders to assess the health of the service.
