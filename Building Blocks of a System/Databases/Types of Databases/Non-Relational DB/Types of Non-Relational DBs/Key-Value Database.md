**Key-value databases** use key-value methods like hash tables to store data in key-value pairs.

Here, the key serves as a unique or primary key, and the values can be anything ranging from simple scalar values to complex objects. 

### Examples:
###### Amazon DynamoDB, Redis, and Memcached DB.

### Use-Case:

Session oriented-applications, such as web applications, store users’ data in the main memory or in a database during a session.

This data may include user profile information, recommendations, targeted promotions, discounts, and more. 

A unique ID (a key) is assigned to each user’s session for easy access and storage.
