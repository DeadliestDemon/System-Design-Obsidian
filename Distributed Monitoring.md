## Monitoring:

The modern economy depends on the continual operation of IT infrastructure. Such infrastructure contains hardware, distributed services, and network resources. These components are interlinked in such infrastructure, making it challenging to keep everything functioning smoothly and without application downtime.

Components can run into failures, response latency overshoot, overloaded or unreachable hardware, and containers running out of resources, among others. Multiple services are running in such an infrastructure, and anything can go awry.

Monitoring helps in analyzing such complex infrastructure where something is constantly failing. Monitoring distributed systems entails gathering, interpreting, and displaying data about the interactions between processes that are running at the same time. It assists in debugging, testing, performance evaluation, and having a bird’s-eye view over multiple services.
