# Building Blocks for a System
System design problems usually have some similarities, though specific details are often unique. We can use these blocks to assemble a system to further cement our understanding. 

Some commonly used Building blocks - 
1. **[[DNS]] (Domain Name System)**
	Focuses on how to design hierarchical and distributed naming systems for computers connected to the Internet via different Internet protocols.
	
2. **[[Load Balancer]]**
	Used to fairly distribute incoming clientsâ€™ requests among a pool of available servers. It also reduces load and can bypass failed servers.
	
3. **[[Databases]]**
	 Enables us to store, retrieve, modify, and delete data in connection with different data-processing procedures.
	 
4. **[[Key-Value Store]]**
	A non-relational database that stores data in the form of a key-value pair.
	
5. **[[CDN]] (Content Delivery Network)**
	Used to keep viral content such as videos, images, audio, and webpages. It efficiently delivers content to end users while reducing latency and burden on the data centers.
	
6. **[[Sequencer]]**
	Unique IDs generator with a major focus on maintaining causality.
	
7. **[[Distributed Monitoring]]**
	Critical in distributed systems because they help analyze the system and alert the stakeholders if a problem occurs.
	
8. [[Distributed Cache]]
	 Multiple cache servers coordinate to store frequently accessed data.
	 
9. **[[Distributed MQ]] (Message Queue)**
	A Queue consisting of multiple servers, which is used between interacting entities called producers and consumers. It helps decouple producers and consumers, results in independent scalability, and enhances reliability.
	
10. [[Pub-Sub]]
11. [[Rate Limiter]]
12. [[Blob Store]]
13. [[Distributed Search]]
14. [[Distributed Logging]]
15. [[Distributed Task Scheduler]]
16. [[Shared Counters]]
