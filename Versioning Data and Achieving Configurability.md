Imagine you have a team of people working on the same document at different locations. Sometimes, the internet connection breaks, or someone's computer stops working while they are updating the document. When this happens, the different versions of the document might not match anymore. So, we need a way to make sure that we don't lose any of the updates and that the final document is consistent.

To solve this, we want to keep track of the order in which updates happened. One way to do this is by using timestamps like "date and time" to see which update came first. However, time can be tricky in a system with many computers because they might not all agree on the exact time.

Instead, we can use something called "vector clocks."
So, if we see that two versions of the document have different vector clocks, we know that they are not related to each other, and there might be conflicting changes. We need to figure out how to combine them correctly, so we have a consistent and complete document in the end. This process of combining and resolving conflicting changes is essential to keep everything in order and make sure the document is reliable.
